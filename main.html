            Introduction
        </h3>
        <p class="text">
            My name is Jakub Zahora. I was born in Poland, and at the age of eleven I moved to the United States. I have been using a computer for as long as I remember, and I was always
            curious and passionate about how it works, and what it can achieve. In my free time I like to play video games, as well as doing a little bit of photogrophy on the side. 
            I am at my fourth year at Lewis University, and I am majoring (hopefully soon) in Computer Science.
